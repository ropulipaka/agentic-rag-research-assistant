# Agentic RAG Research Assistant

## Project Status

This is a GitHub import from `ropulipaka/agentic-rag-research-assistant`.

**Important:** The imported repository is currently empty. It contains only:
- A README.md file with just the project title
- A LICENSE file
- No source code
- No configuration files
- No dependencies

## What This Means

The GitHub repository appears to have been initialized but never populated with actual code. To build an agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) research assistant, you'll need to either:

1. Check if there's a different repository or branch with the actual code
2. Start building the application from scratch
3. Find the correct source repository if this was imported by mistake

## Typical RAG Research Assistant Components

A typical agentic RAG research assistant would include:
- A backend (usually Python with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar)
- Vector database integration (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, etc.)
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)
- Document processing and embedding pipeline
- Frontend interface (optional - could be Streamlit, Gradio, or a web framework)

## Next Steps

Please verify:
- Is this the correct repository?
- Should we build this from scratch?
- Is there another source for this code?
